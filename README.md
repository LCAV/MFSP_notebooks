[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamscholefield/)

This rep contains a jupyter notebook for teaching finite dimensional inverse problems.

For simplicity, you can run the notebook using Binder: [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamscholefield/](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamscholefield/)

Alternatively, if you wish to run the notebook locally, a list of required packages is given in the requirements.txt.
