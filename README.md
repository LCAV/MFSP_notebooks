[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamscholefield/MFSP_notebooks/master)

This rep contains jupyter notebooks for teaching mathematical foundations of signal processing.

For simplicity, you can run the notebooks using Binder: [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamscholefield/MFSP_notebooks/master](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamscholefield/MFSP_notebooks/master)

Alternatively, if you wish to run the notebooks locally, a list of required packages is given in the requirements.txt.

## List of notebooks:

The following notebooks are included:
1. Finite dimensional inverse problems: a geometrical perspective
2. FRI simple: a basic Anihilatig Filter example
3. Basis Expansion: visualsiation and orthogonalisation of bases of function spaces 
4. Projections: approximating functions with help of projection theorem
